  <h2>Coming Soon</h2>
  <p>Wordtile is a place where users share text(like a forum). The name is a modern Anglicised blend of German roots: Wort meaning "word" and Teilen meaning "to share." It shows the idea of a word-part or the sharing of a word.</p>
  <p>Pronounced WORT-ile (rhymes with "short mile"), IPA: /wɔːrˈtaɪl/, it has the  German 'ei' sound for a unique sound.</p>
  <p>Inspired by linguistic forms like participles and morphemes, Wordtile shows the beauty of language in motion, where all words are vital infomation. Infomation is the internet.</p>
  
  <p>Wortile will be coded with HTML, CSS, JS and Python</p>
